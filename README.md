 Hello stranger! We are IQ Mafia.

You have wandered to the page of a unique project. It was created for those who love the sports mafia. With this application, the judge no longer needs papers, cards and other paraphernalia, only a phone.

For contributors:
- we use Redux Architecture
- we have separate UI shared module with Jetpack Compose compiling for Android and iOS
- We use shared ViewModel as Redux controller
- Our backend is own self-made and deliver rest API for auth and flexible database ability
- For dependency injections we use Koin

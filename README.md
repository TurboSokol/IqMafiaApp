Hello stranger! We are IQ Mafia.

You have came accross to a unique project. It was created for those who love the sports mafia. With this application, any paper, cards and other paraphernalia no longer required. Just a phone.

If you are a contributor, you need to know the following:
- We use Redux Architecture;
- We have standalone module with Jetpack Compose UI shared between Android and iOS;
- We use shared ViewModel as Redux controller;
- Our own backend delivers rest API for auth and flexible database ability;
- For dependency injections we use Koin;
- We chose Ktor as a network manager;
